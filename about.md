Dear visitors,

This is Mehdi! I am a Machine Learning Engineer and a Computational Linguist. My PhD research was around grounded language modelling with neural networks and my current machine learning work is focused applicaiton of large neural language models in legal domain. This website is my blog. So, I share several different things here: sometimes my work/research-related observations and thoughts, and sometimes I write up about life even pictures. :)

I am sure you can [google me](https://www.google.com/webhp?q=Mehdi+Ghanimifard) and see what you can find out about me on the Internet. I can also confirm that my twitter account is [@mmehdig](https://twitter.com/mmehdig) (not a robot).

### Questions?

1. I googled "Mehdi Ghanimifard", but I found "Mohammad Mehdi Ghanimifard"! is this you?
- Yes, we are the same person! "Mohammad Mehdi" is my *official* birth name. People who know me call me "Mehdi". If you are working for a bank or somewhere that I am the customer, using any of the following names are fine with me: "Mohammad Mehdi", "Mohammad", "Mehdi".
2. Do you have Facebook? Could you add me on Facebook or follow me on Twitter?
- Sure! Maybe! I only have people in my Facebook's friends list who I have physically met. On my Twitter, I follow a mixture of professionals who I met physically, or I follow them to know about their point of view. I should thank you if you follow me on social media; hopefully, I share meaningful things online. However, I wouldn't "follow back".
3. I have a question for you, how can I contact you?
- Try that google thing again, and find my email, phone number or whatever works for you!
4. How do you write your name in your native language?
- My mother tongue is Persian, and I write it this way: "مهدی". My surname is "غنیمی‌فرد". Other names: "محمد مهدی"
5. چرا از اول فارسی نمی‌نویسی که مخاطب‌های فارسی زبان بیشتری داشته باشی؟
- چشم! فارسی هم در آینده می‌نویسم. وبلاگ من خیلی قدیم کامل فارسی بود.
دلیل اصلی فارسی ننوشتن اینه که مخاطب‌های کاری من بیشترشان فارسی زبان نیستند.
