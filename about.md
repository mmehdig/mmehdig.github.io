This is Mehdi! I am a PhD candidate at Universitu of Gothenburg. I am interested in language modeling in connection with other modalities such as vision. This is my blog so I share several different things here, sometimes my work related observations and thoughts, and sometimes I just write about life and pictures. :)

I am sure you can [google me](https://www.google.com/webhp?q=Mehdi+Ghanimifard) and see what you can find out about me on Internet. Anyways, some essentials: I can confirm that my twitter account is [@mmehdig](https://twitter.com/mmehdig) (not a robot). I also have a [page on university website](http://clasp.gu.se/about/people/mehdi-ghanimifard), where you can find my office address and more detailed  work contact information.

### Questions?

1. I googled "Mehdi Ghanimifard" but I found "Mohammad Mehdi Ghanimifard"! is it you?
- Yes, we are the same person! "Mohammad Mehdi" is my official birth name. Many people don't know that I have different name on my birth certificate and many don't know that my name is actually "Mehdi".
2. Do you have Facebook? Could you add me on Facebook?
- Sure! Maybe! I only have people in my Facebook's friends list who I have physically met.
3. I have a question how can I contact you?
- Try that google thing and find my email, phone number or whatever works for you!
4. How do you write your name in your native language?
- My mother tongue is Persian and I write it this way: "مهدی". My surname is "غنیمی‌فرد".
5. چرا از اول فارسی نمی‌نویسی که مخاطب‌های فارسی زبان بیشتری داشته باشی؟
- چشم فارسی هم در آینده می‌نویسم. وبلاگ من خیلی قدیم کامل فارسی بود.
دلیل اصلی فارسی ننوشتن اینه که مخاطب‌هایی کاری من بیشترشان فارسی زبان نیستند.
