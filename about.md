This is Mehdi! After a long long absence in writing blog and sharing thoughts, I am back. I am a Phd student in Computational Linguistics at University of Gothenburg since September 2015. These days I am interested in natural language processing grounded in perceptual reality. Let's see how much I can share my observations and experiments in my blog.

I am sure you can [google me](https://www.google.com/webhp?q=Mehdi+Ghanimifard) and see what you can find out about me on Internet. Anyway some essentials: I can confirm that my twitter account is [@mmehdig](https://twitter.com/mmehdig) which is real me not a robot. I also have a [page on university website](http://clasp.gu.se/about/people/mehdi-ghanimifard), where you can find my office address and more detailed contact information.

### Questions?

1. I googled "Mehdi Ghanimifard" but I found "Mohammad Mehdi Ghanimifard"! is it you?
- Yes, we are the same person! "Mohammad Mehdi" is my official birth name. Many people don't know that I have different name on my birth certificate and many don't know that my name is actually "Mehdi".
2. Do you have Facebook? Could you add me on Facebook?
- Sure! Maybe! I only have people in my Facebook's friends list who I have physically met.
3. I have a question how can I contact you?
- Try that google thing and find my email, phone number or whatever works for you!
