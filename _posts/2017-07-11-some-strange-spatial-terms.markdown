I would like to put these strange sentences here for fun! Maybe I expand it as a blog post. These are sentences that I either heard from people or I made it up myself.

![Northern Ireland ][northern ireland]

"*Northern Ireland* is in south of northern part of *Ireland*."


![South Pars/North Dome][gas field]

"*South Pars/North Dome* is a gas field which its northern part is called *South Pars* and its southern part is called *North Dome*"
