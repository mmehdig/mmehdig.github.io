I am back! Let's hope that it will stays this way. The plan is to work on blog posts on Sundays and publish them on Monday mornings. This blog posts will be about my thoughts, feelings, codes, and things that I will call tutorials! There will be posts in Persian as well, like before I will try to have translations for those posts.

Well, writing this short post and renewing the whole website costed me a good loooooong time on Sunday AND Monday! Let's hope for a better time management in future.
