Recently [an internal message between googlers][gizmodo link] raised a lot of
media attention and discussions about diversity as an issue in IT and computer
science departments. We all kind of know that these discussions will not go away
soon because lack of diversity in certain fields (racial and gender) is an
issue. I didn't even read the message because the quoted sections in news was
enough to make my mind: the author of this memo needs learn more about
complicated aspects of the issue. The false argument directly linking biological
differences with social status is not just wrong, it can hurt people. Then after
Google fired the guy. I read [this article in the Atlantic][theatlantic link],
which convinced me to take a look at the full-text memo (the Gizmodo link above).

I came to this conclusion: This former-googler (28yrs James Damore) crossed some
lines and his words hurt a group of people, at the same time I believe he was
treated unfairly by the media and his former employer. Frankly, I believe firing
him was the easiest option for Google but not the best. It seems to me they
wanted to get rid of attacks from media. The message by the VP of Diversity in
Google, Danielle Brown, didn't really convinced me. In her letter (you can fide
it in first I put above), she argues in order to build an open, inclusive
environment, we need a discourse pro to our the principles. To me, it is fine!
A company can ask their employees "if you say things that hurt our values and
other colleagues we will fire you" but this easily can land in the opposite
definition of an open environment.

I found [Susan Wojcicki's comments][fortune link] (CEO of YouTube) more
relevant. She expressed how painful it is to read such hurtful claims from
a co-worker. Then, she argues that if we replace the word "Women" with other
groups, for example "Blacks", then it would be imaginable to have a "universal
call for swift action against its author". This is actually a good point to
start the discussion. However, I disagree with this argument that if it hurts,
it should be banded! I believe Google could do better by turning this situation
into an opportunity to educate staff and having a serious conversation about
diversity in IT companies. If the goal is to build a discourse basing it on how
hurtful a talking point is to others only goes toward more gaps. By firing
someone who expressed his absurd opinion in an internal memo, they created a
right wing martyr out of this guy.

In final words, I have to express even more that I don't see any point in
creating discourse based on blandly false claims. â€ŒBut when one side of the
argument is choosing to reason based on factless statements the discourse must
be about agreeing on what we all accept as facts. If we skip this step, any
other attempts is doomed to be considered as subjective personal opinions. I
simply think that if Google truly want to deal with diversity problem, they must
do more than firing those who don't understand why diversity matters.
