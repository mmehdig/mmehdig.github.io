I am writing from Iran! I came here for my sister's wedding. I would like to
share my recent experience in using mobile apps and Internet in Iran. A few days
before the wedding, I went to a barbershop with my brother-in-law. Using public
transportation in Tehran for the most part of the city costs hours, that's why
uber-like services are blooming. We got there using one of the major apps. The
barber saw my android device and said something like: "Good choice! you won't
have the 1009 error, like us iPhone users". I asked what is he talking about,
and it turns out that Apple, following the recent US sanctions against Iran,
decided to put sanctions on all kinds of purchases from Iran, including any free
apps on App Store. The general solution is to basically sign out of apple
services including App Store. Then, the apps you had purchased before traveling
to Iran will work without the error message. A day after the wedding something
else happened! Apple completely removed apps which had backing companies in Iran
from App Store[1](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/25/16201434/apple-iran-app-store-removal-sanctions-trump), including the one I used. Well, it wasn't because these companies were in Iran,
It was because they couldn't adapt the Apple's payment platform in Iran's
banking system, instead their product was relying on available mobile payments
in Iran.

I wouldn't be surprised if Apple blocks services to users in Iran! Similar cases
happened before. Just like car companies that during the 90's stoped providing
official spare parts and service centers inside Iran. Trade ministry of Iran
responded to that case by making it illegal to import such cars. With reasoning
that the costumers' safety is in danger if these cars cannot get proper services
inside Iran. I don't know if something similar can happen to iPhone and
IT-products. It seems Iran considers this as a violation to free trades.

The new and young minister of ICT, Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, responded to
this new event on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/azarijahromi/status/900567260791791616),
by expressing the magnitude of iPhone market in Iran and possible legal actions
that Iran can take against this.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="fa" dir="rtl">۱۱% سهم بازار گوشی ایران متعلق به اپل است. احترام به حقوق مصرف کننده امروزه یک اصل است که اپل رعایت نکرده. حذف اپها را پیگیری حقوقی میکنیم.</p>&mdash; MJ Azari Jahromi (@azarijahromi) <a href="https://twitter.com/azarijahromi/status/900567260791791616">August 24, 2017</a></blockquote>

Basically, he says Apple is not respecting the costumers right and their
ministry will seeks for finding possible legal actions. Clearly, both companies
and costumers in Iran hurt from the Apple's decision but government regulations
not always tries to help both groups. The government of Iran is famous for its
censorship tools which blocks websites and access to certain parts of Internet.
However, with infrastructural developments now more users have access to 3G and
4G Internet on their mobile phones which increased the demand for online mobile
services. I actually used the 3G and 4G Internet by buying a one-month package.
But, I just recently when the period reached to its end I received a
notification message with details of internet costs if I exit the package.
Surprisingly, the price for using Internet with servers outside Iran I have to
pay more comparing to using part of the Internet and websites inside Iran!
This is a text-book example of none-neutral Internet service.

Next time, I will be back and write something about my work hopefully.
