`U+200F` is a zero width Unicode character to mark right-to-left blocks of characters.
In my opinion, it is an entirely useless character. It makes text processing unnecessary harder, and it usually doesn't do what you need for marking direction. Render engines can handle bidirectional texts, such as writing this test "این متن آزمایشی" here. Moreover, there is usually no key button in any keyboard layout dedicated to this character.

Aha, back to the main topic! Why did I change my blog name to U200F?
The answer is pretty simple. Two reasons:
(1) The previous name was boring "Just a blog"
(2)It is not a secret that I am not a native English speaker. I frequently make mistakes in my writings, so it needs a marker to indicate you are not reading a cleaned up regular English language text. You are welcome! :D
