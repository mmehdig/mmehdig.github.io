### About me and my research

I am PhD candidate in Computational Linguistics. My research is in grounded language generation and understanding with neural language models. The aim is to combine linguistic representations with uncertain perceptual representations in a single framework.

I think fusion of different modalities is one of the core questions in modelling meaning.
In a sense, understanding is about changing several representations or mapping them into an actionable representation.
Modelling language essentially deals with high level representations of concepts and their internal meanings in relation with each other.
When we deal with grounded language in visual perception, several different levels of representations for both vision and language models is required.
This is why neural language models are powerful tools to encode knowledge about the world as representations of concepts.
This knowledge must be able to explain "when" and "where" system needs "what" kind of composition and fusion of representations.
Modelling spatial language deals with all these aspects. This is why the focus of my research is mainly on spatial language.

In addition to my research as PhD student, I have been TA for following courses in Master in Language Technology (MLT) programme in last three/four years:

- Artificial intelligence: Cognitive systems (Formerly: "Embodied and Situated Language Processing") (November-January)
- Statistical Methods for NLP (January to March)
- Computational Semantics (April-June)
