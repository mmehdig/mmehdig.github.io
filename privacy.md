Dear visitor,

I respect your privacy. This website is hosted on Github which provides free hosting for static pages. Basically, I don't collect user informations (no cookies üç™). But! I have Google analytics which will monitor user visits and gives me a report. Additionally, I have some other online applications (Google API, Twitter, Facebook and bunch of other tools) which am not going to use them to collect any information without your consent. 

Please contact me if you have any question.

Best,

Mehdi
